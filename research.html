    <h2>The BrainTrain research project</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>(a) investigates the neurocognitive mechanisms of working memory (WM) training and executive functioning in general,</li>
        <li>(b) explores factors that predict executive functioning and WM training outcomes,</li>
        <li>(c) studies the effects of brain stimulation on WM training,</li>
        <li>(d) examines the applicability of WM training in clinical conditions.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
    For these purposes, the research group utilizes a wide array of methods, including cognitive-experimental tasks, functional brain imaging by neurophysiological, haemodynamic and neurotransmitter activity measures, and transient direct current stimulation of the brain.
