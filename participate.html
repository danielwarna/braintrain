<p>
We are looking for participants for a study on performance stability in executive function tests. The participants will do the same computerized tasks in two separate sessions during the course of seven days (less than 1 hour each time).
</p>

<p>
One of the sessions will be completed from home, on your own computer (smart phones and tablet computers are not suitable for this) and he other one will take place in a computer class at Åbo Akademi University (Stansen in the ASA-house at Fänriksgatan 3). You can choose among many alternatives, which day and what time you want to do the session in the computer class.
</p>

<p>
As compensation for participation you will receive a movie ticket. The requirement for this is that you?re not an employee at Åbo Akademi University.
</p>
Participants are required to have good skills in the English language to guarantee comprehension of the instructions that will be given before each task. Also, participants are required to be at least 18 years of age and should not have a mental or neurologic illness/disorder, or a reading and writing disability.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in participating, please send an e-mail to Gerda.Kraemer@abo.fi and you will receive further instructions. Tel: 0442696233
