Some previous research has found bilinguals to perform better than monolinguals on tasks measuring executive functioning, indicating an advantage for bilinguals in certain cognitive functions. However, more recent research has failed to find differences between bilingual and monolingual children, and thus question the prevalence of such an advantage. Our new article investigated whether there was a difference between monolingual children and early simultaneous bilingual children in their performance on selected subtests from WISC-IV and NEPSY-II. One hundred Finland-Swedish children in two age groups (7-year-olds and 10–11-year-olds) were tested, and the results revealed no difference in performance between the monolinguals and bilinguals. This speaks against a cognitive advantage in bilingual children and indicates that development of separate norms for monolingual and bilingual children is not needed for clinical use of these tests.
