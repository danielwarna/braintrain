title: Is there a bilingual advantage in working memory?
category: news
---

Our research article, “Bilingualism and working memory performance: Evidence from a large-scale online study” just came out in PLOS ONE. We investigated working memory performance in groups of monolinguals, early bilinguals and late bilinguals. The late bilingual group performed significantly better in working memory updating tasks, but the advantage was not related with bilingual experience. Our findings are in line with the meta-analysis our study group published early this year (Lehtonen et al., “Is bilingualism associated with enhanced executive functioning in adults? A meta-analytic review.”). To read the research article, check the following link:
