In collaboration with our colleagues in Australia and the US, we have published a new study on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and its limitations for working memory enhancement in healthy adults. The study came out in Frontiers in Neuroscience and is available at the following address: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00738/full/](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00738/full/)
