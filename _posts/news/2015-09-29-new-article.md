During the last ten years, working memory training has been a popular and debated field of research. In our new article we investigated the effects of working memory updating training on different aspects of cognitive functions (with an emphasis on near transfer). Thirty-one healthy young adults were randomized into a working memory training or active control group. The results corroborate the notion that working memory training produces near transfer effects, and that the extent of the transfer effects are related to the cognitive overlap between the training and transfer meaures.
