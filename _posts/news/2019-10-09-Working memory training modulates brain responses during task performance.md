title: Working memory training modulates brain responses during task performance
category: news

Our recently published EEG study shows how working memory training elicits changes in several event-related potentials during task performance. Slow-wave potentials previously linked to working memory maintenance did also show changes following training, suggesting improved maintenance of currently active information in working memory when the task load was high.
