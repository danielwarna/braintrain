BrainTrain collaborator Professor Lars Nyberg fr책n Ume책 University will give a guest lecture in Turku at the Biocity Frontiers of Science seminar. The title of his talk is "Multimodal brain imaging of memory functioning in adulthood and aging".

The venue is Mauno Koivisto Conference Center, President Auditorium, BioCity, Turku, and the one-hour talk starts at 12 o'clock. Coffee/tea and sandwiches are served before the seminar, starting at 11:45. Welcome!

Lars Nyberg is a professor of neuroscience (Radiation Sciences & Integrative Medical Biology) at the Ume책 University. He is also the director of the Ume책 Center for Functional Brain Imaging (UFBI). Professor Nyberg's highly cited research focuses on brain imaging of memory functions in healthy and diseased individuals, and on large-scale longitudinal studies on determinants of cognitive decline in aging. To study brain functions, the main technique he employs is functional brain imaging with PET and fMRI. Professor Nyberg has received several prestigious awards for his research, including the Gustafsson prize in medicine in 2007. Since 2008 he has been a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
