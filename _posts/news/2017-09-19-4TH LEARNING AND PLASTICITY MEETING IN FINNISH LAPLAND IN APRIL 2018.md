FIRST CALL FOR THE FOURTH LEARNING AND PLASTICITY MEETING, Äkäslompolo, Finland, April 
8-11, 2018


A cross-disciplinary meeting that connects psychological and neuroscience research on the 
mechanisms of learning and brain plasticity.


The special theme of the LaP 2018 meeting is ageing but submissions reflecting the whole 
spectrum of learning and plasticity research are encouraged.


The LaP 2018 keynote speaker is Professor Kirk Erickson (Brain Aging & Cognitive Health 
Lab, University of Pittsburgh, USA). Informal atmosphere and small size (maximum 100 participants) helps to connect 
participants and promotes discussion. Excellent possibilities for winter sports and other outdoors activities
Despite of its location way above the Polar Circle, the congress site is easy to reach by 
flight or by train.

Hope to see you at the Heart of Finnish Lapland in Spring 2018!
