Dear colleague,

The Third Annual Learning and Plasticity (LaP) meeting in Finnish Lapland is approaching! This cross-disciplinary meeting connects psychological and neuroscience research on the mechanisms of learning and brain plasticity. It is organized by the Åbo Akademi University, the University of Turku, and the Turku Brain and Mind Center. 

The confirmed highlights of the meeting include a keynote by Professor Manuel Carreiras (Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language), a workshop on the use of transcranial direct current stimulation in research organized by Associate Professor Marcus Meinzer (University of Queensland), and three symposia on the following topics: Cognitive effects of bilingualism and language learning, Attention control in the lab and in real life - from basic brain mechanisms to clinical training intervention, and Efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation - the role of individual differences and task demands. 

The special theme of the 2017 meeting is adult language learning/bilingualism that is reflected in the congress keynote and one of the symposia. However, as before, most of the congress program will consist of free papers that reflect the whole spectrum of learning and plasticity research. 

Despite of its northern location, the congress site is easy to reach e.g. by daily flight connections from Helsinki to the nearby airport at Kittilä. The congress program runs from afternoon to evening, enabling one to utilize the excellent possibilities for various winter sports and other outdoor activities during the long days in early April. Due to auditorium space and to keep the meeting highly interactive, the number of participants is limited to 100. Please make your travel arrangements in good time as the flights and the night trains tend to become fully booked due to the number of tourists coming to enjoy the unique Lappish Spring.

See you in Lapland in April, 
Matti Laine, PhD
Head of the Organizing Committee 
Professor, Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland
